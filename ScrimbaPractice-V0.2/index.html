                    <h3>When <span class="r34-color">GTR-34</span> came up ?</h3>
                    <p>The basic model of the <em>R34 GT-R</em> is simply called the 'R34 GT-R'. This was produced from January 1999 (when the first R34 GT-R's rolled off the production line) to the end of production in 2002. The R34 GT-R retained the much loved RB26DETT engine from its predecessors, the R32 and the R33.</p>

                   <h3>What makes special GTR-34 ?</h3> 
                   <p>In particular, the GT-R name lived for a very long time, too, and all of the generations have raced in various racing series. The road cars were all very, very tunable, as emphasised by the Fast & Furious movie series, thus bringing up demand so much that R34 prices have soared to around US$100,000.</p>
